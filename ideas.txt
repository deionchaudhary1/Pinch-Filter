create a 3 finger scroll that the camera could recognize in order to move between different spaces
create a pinch motion to move between and create tabs
create a finger distortion camera (like ones in the DS)

^create a whole directory of settings the user can toggle from\

FOR PIE
- create a system in which we can detect is robots are blocking each other (they are too close)
    - technically, this can be done without AI, if we add location devices to each robot (however, with AI its faster)

WITH ARDUINO
- create a brightness sensor that changes the brightness of the computer (or goes to night mode), based on the brightness reading on the arduino
- can technically also do this with openCV
